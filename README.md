# Budget Web App
Web application to keep track of expenses and balances between friends and family members.
This was the final project for the university course of Web Programming. We had to implement the back-end and the front-end of an application to keep track of expenses and balances between friends and family members.
Users can share their expenses and each user can pay a different amount of money. The app has to then check who is in debt, and by how much, and who is owed money. It can tell who has to send money to whom to balance out said debts.
